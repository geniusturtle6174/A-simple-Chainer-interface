# A-simple-Chainer-interface

A simple interface encapsulating Chainer functions to something like MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron). It let you adjust hyper parameters (number of nodes, number of layers, activation and cost functions, ...) without using if/else and for loops on the top level scripts.

## Special Notes

1. Tested under Chainer 1.8.2
2. Currenty the author is not able to test this again, but readers are still welcome to discuss.
